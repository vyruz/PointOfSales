Implement a class DrinkItem(MenuItem)

which is a menu item. Then make the two subclasses
Alcohol and SoftDrink 

SoftDrink should pretty much be the same as DrinkItem,
HardDrink should have an alcohol content (ABV) but otherwise is the same.


You should be able to do this pretty easily based off of our code for MenuItem and FoodItem (which is a subclass of MenuItem)
